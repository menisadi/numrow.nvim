*numrow.txt*   Train number-row symbols

INTRODUCTION                                            *numrow*
numrow.nvim is a small game to train number-row symbol muscle memory.

USAGE                                                   *numrow-usage*
:NumRow
    Open the menu and start a session.

CONFIGURATION                                           *numrow-config*
require('numrow').setup({opts})

Options:
  rounds (number)             Number of rounds. Default: 10
  feedback ("offset"|"warm")  Feedback mode. Default: "offset"
  show_hint_on_miss (bool)    Show the "Shift+<digit>" hint. Default: false
  symbols (table)             Target symbols (layout dependent)
  digits (table)              Digits aligned with symbols
  score (table)               Scoring options: base, penalty, min
                              Default: { base = 10, penalty = 2, min = 1 }
  win (table)                 Floating window options: width, height, border

SCORING                                                *numrow-scoring*
There are two scoring metrics:
  Points: Each round awards points based on:
    score = base - penalty * mistakes
    where mistakes is attempts - 1 (the correct attempt), and the result is
    clamped to score.min.
  Accuracy: correct/attempts.
After a session, the summary screen shows score/accuracy and lets you restart,
return to the menu, or quit.
